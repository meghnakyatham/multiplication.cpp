# multiplication.cpp
**Matrix Multiplication Program Readme**

This repository contains a C++ program that performs matrix multiplication. The program takes input for two matrices and calculates their multiplication, storing the result in another matrix.

### Program Description

The program begins by asking the user to enter the dimensions of the two matrices: the number of rows and columns for each matrix. It ensures that the number of columns in the first matrix is equal to the number of rows in the second matrix for the multiplication to be valid. If the dimensions are not compatible, an error message is displayed, and the user is prompted to re-enter the dimensions.

After inputting the dimensions, the program proceeds to input the elements of both matrices. The elements of the first matrix (`a`) and the second matrix (`b`) are obtained from the user. The program then performs the matrix multiplication operation, where each element of the resulting matrix (`mult`) is calculated as the sum of the products of corresponding elements from the row of the first matrix and the column of the second matrix.

Finally, the resulting matrix is displayed in the console, showing the output of the matrix multiplication.

### How to Compile and Run

1. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system (e.g., g++, Visual C++, etc.).
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the program source code is saved.
4. Compile the program using the following command:

   ```
   g++ matrix_multiplication.cpp -o matrix_multiplication
   ```

   Replace `matrix_multiplication.cpp` with the actual name of the source code file if it's different.

5. Run the compiled executable:

   ```
   ./matrix_multiplication
   ```

6. Follow the prompts to enter the matrix dimensions and elements.

### Note

This program showcases a basic implementation of matrix multiplication in C++. It's important to handle edge cases, error scenarios, and input validation for a more robust application. Additionally, it's a good practice to modularize the code into functions for better readability and maintainability.
